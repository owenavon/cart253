# Project 1 - Acorn Catcher

This purpose of this program is to create a simulation in which the user must achieve a specific goal within a given amount of time. In this instance, the user will attempt to collect 500 acorn points within 25 seconds.

Plan:
1) Create a basic program with 4 states: landing, simulation, winner and loser.
2) Create 4 ellipses. 3 of which will generate a random x position and translate vertically down the y-axis.
3) Provide user control via the left and right arrow keys, to allow for horizontal movement of 1 ellipse on the x-axis.
4) Use the distance parameter to create an outcome when the ellipses touch the user control ellipse. Such as provide points to the score board.
5) Create a timer and point system that will dictate the outcome of the game depending on time remaining and points achieved.
6) Add sound effects / music and replace the ellipses with pixel art characters to encapsulate the envisioned 16-bit theme to the game. Change the default font to something retro.
7) Test the game with much attention and, organize the code into functions / comment the code.
